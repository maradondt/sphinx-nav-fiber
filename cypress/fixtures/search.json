      "text": "So I like what Tomer and Tao and others were saying about optimism and maybe we can talk about in the new year. What do we have to look forward to? I think this will come up over and over as we kind of finish the year and move on to 2023. But yeah, I don't know if tomorrow what always happens in the year before the having is people start to have the discussion is the having price thing and people start to run all these numbers around. If miners are generating this much and selling that much and then they're only going to generate this much and they'll only be able to sell that much and this as much as flowing in. And so all these hypotheticals start to get going and this really gets I mean, we've seen this in previous cycles. The magnitude of the having is half as much each time, but it's nevertheless material and relevant and people are going to run all kinds of models and all kinds of numbers. Not to say that any of them are right, but it gets all this discussion going about what is the scarcity of this asset, and it creates more knowledge about bitcoin in general. It's in a sense it creates all this free press because people are starting to talk about it. So I think one of the things that's going to be a point for discussion, especially as we get to within the twelve month window, which is going to be around May or late April, it just depends on Ashley. Fluctuations is going to be lots of people talking about this upcoming having of the bitcoin that the supply is going to get drastically reduced and what's that going to mean for its price, given that the demand is probably not changing? Demand flat or up as a result of this supply down, price up. What does that mean? It's always an exciting time. We're kind of in the worst part, we've been through the worst part in the last year. It's like the time, the furthest time between havings has always historically been a period where if price is going to go language, that's when it happens and we've seen it for sure. So we'll be able to talk about something other than macro for once. And also the silver lining for all these blow ups, and I really do silver, silver lining is that you're seeing a record amount of outflows going out of exchanges. You're seeing people like taking self custody seriously. And that makes me extremely bullish. I think self custody is really how you actually effectuate change. If people don't take self custody, it's just a repetition of the old system. It's a continuation of that. So that made me extremely optimistic. Also you have the rise of these very powerful bitcoin only companies as well. That makes me optimistic. The space has been just littered with just bitcoin and ship coin companies for the longest time and now you're seeing the rise of truly bitcoin only companies. They're really making an impact. And then also you're starting to hear, and you're starting to see the seep in to mainstream media that bitcoin is not crypto. Right. You had Tucker Carlson is the second most popular broadcaster in the United States. He went from having Michael Sailor to Naim Bukhaili to Max Kaiser. Right. You had, oh my God, what's the other name of the broadcaster? Well you're having these very large broadcasters talking about oh that's right. You had the broadcaster, the second most popular political broadcast in the United States, talking about the idea of ending the fed. They're identifying the problems of basically the government being able to create money for free that everyone has to work for. In my humble opinion. I think it's just a matter of time before the idea of bitcoin seeps into that. Because if you think about it, it's always the same thing. It's like they're identifying a problem, they're seeking a political solution. But the political solution is not viable. The political solution look, either political party is not incentivized to work for the people. They're incentivized to get as close as humanly possible to the money spicket right. So the only really alternative to that is just to opt out of the system entirely. And I think that's what's actually going to effectuate change. And I think this all happened in the last two years, not to mention ExxonMobil Shell. What's the other one? Conoco Phillips Gasprom you had the largest energy company in Japan all getting into bitcoin mining in some type of way, right? That's absolutely massive. Right. And that kind of goes back into the Mac Kaiser's theory of Bitcoin is going to 51% attack the world's energy. So, I mean, like, look, I think a lot of people are getting distracted with the shitcoin exchange blow ups, right? If you took self custody, none of that, it would have affected you. But in terms of adoption, I think we've never been in a stronger position and I think we just need to keep putting on that pressure heading into 2023. And then, of course, the having is going to do a lot of the heavy lifting. But, yeah, man, it really falls down to us individuals to really push that message forward and get the ideals and ethos of bitcoin into the mainstream consciousness of the average person here in the US and in the world. You raised a bunch of good points, Nico, but I want to touch on the first one you raised. Proof of case day January 3. It's coming up. Is this the first Proof of Keys day where we're actually watching coins on exchanges fly off exchanges leading into the event? I think that's going to be really interesting. What is it? Something like 200,000 coins have left exchanges in the past month. That should be a grab your popcorn event this January, just to piggyback off of what was tomorrow is talking about a year out from a having. And let's look at the numbers real quick, because starting after that having, there's only 164,000 Bitcoin that will be hitting the market that year. That's how scarce is becoming with these havings. And to put that in perspective, as you know, you've got MicroStrategy themselves that purchase 130,000, there's not much, man. And when these other companies see how it's getting scarce, they jump in. Guess what? They watch what happened with FTX. They watched everything blow up this year, all right? They're going to have the organization in place to self custody. So you're just going to see, I think, a lot of these corporations come in and they are pulled up from exchanges. And as I'm saying, like, you say, 200,000 pulled off. So, yeah, I think this was the year of not your keys, not your coin. Absolutely. And people are yeah, look, it's scary at first, man. I remember the first time I sent my bitcoin from an exchange to a lot. I'm like, well, where the hell did it go? It's not showing up yet. What did I just do? But as you get used to it, it's really not bad and the peace of mind it gives you when you're watching all of these exchange crash and you know your bitcoin is secure offline, it's an amazing feeling. So I think that's going to be a big one, at least during the year. I think there's still a lot of pain and things to get flushed out this year from a lot of that quote unquote paper bitcoin still out there. But man, I am optimistic, like you guys are ",

      "text": "This name. Hello. Sorry there it went into all mute for a little bit. No worries. I just wanted to check in and follow up with something that you said yesterday. Oxy about our role to not be psychos in talking with our family and friends to avoid the crazy eyes when we're talking to them but to play the long game with family and friends to know that we have to be sowing seeds about bitcoin not to try to convert someone in one go. And part of that is to understand how to influence people. You mentioned a book that you'd read how to Influence or how to Influence Friends and Make Friends, something like that. How to win friends and influence. That's the one. But there's a ton of books around that by Chilgeini, and I think it's really important that we start to be equipped with some real foundational framings around the environmental fund, et cetera, so that we're able to just have those answers for family and friends that we just need to have with a quiet confidence that this is the truth, this is the way forward, and to just play. That long game when 100% agree. We dropped the article yesterday, orange pilling with a high amount of skepticism. And it's that same idea. It's like, look, guys, we all know the Bitcoin meme of it's going to take a few touches for people to become Bitcoin. Or it is upon us to maybe realize that if you come on a little too strong, you might scare people away. You can do what you want, you can act however you want. But it is very interesting that if you just ask certain questions, if you just start to sow those seeds of doubt into the people around you, it's a very effective way of orange pilling people getting people on the Bitcoin standard. Like, you won't completely convert Bitcoiners in one conversation from Norman to Bitcoin. It's going to be a continuous dialogue of them understanding your point of view to them with facts, trying not to get too crazy on them, but also time in between those conversations so that they can see it for themselves, because this is how humans work. Like, whether you like it or not, human psychology is hardwired in such a way where you're best off by sowing those seeds of doubt. And it could always be different angles. As Bitcoin is, we have so many different angles that we can orange pill people to get to our side. And it really needs to be tailored to the individual that you're talking to. Some people, some messaging it with other peoples. And people have different hierarchies of needs and hierarchy of things that they value. And so you just got to probe what they value the most and then angle Bitcoin into that conversation and just continuously orange pill them. And at times, you might be better off not even mentioning Bitcoin until the second or third conversation. And it's just how humans are. Do not try to spook the person out there by going full Charlie Day auto. ",

      "text": "back to you. So what is the general consensus? Because we know, for example, from senator lumas that a treasury is hostile towards bitcoin. Those are her words, not mine. And we obviously know how senator Elizabeth Warren feels about bitcoin. But what is the general consensus in Washington, specifically now that the republicans took back the house? Well, for a while, there was sort of a bipartisan feeling toward the industry, and there was a few detractors, but at the end of the day, elizabeth Warren and Brad Sherman in the house didn't really have any friends. No one really listened to what they said. So unfortunately, we have Sam bankman freed to thank for the fact that now they do have friends. They have people like Marshall that cosign this bill with Warren. So they're trying to take all these drastic measures, and a lot of people on the democratic side are starting to turn against the notion of bitcoin. Just in general, the industry republicans are much more favorable, and that is huge. In fact, the hero of the moment, in my opinion, is representative Tom emmer, who actually got the chance back in 2016 when I was with the chamber of digital commerce, I was part of a group that helped with educating him when he was first interested in the technology. And he's really very prominently speaking about issues like the ability to peer to peer transactions and protecting the industry, and he's just great. And the reason I mentioned Tom emmer and taking back the house is for a while, emmer people didn't realize this was the number four person in the republican structure. And now he has become the whip, the third ranking house majority whip. And so he's responsible for getting all the republicans on board to vote a certain way when issues come up. That's a really very high profile position. And so one thing that can happen with politicians is sometimes they reach a certain stature and then they're like bitcoin? What's that? I don't remember. And they're on to other, bigger, better things. He's, like, doubled down on the importance of this industry, and has been using his megaphone to the point that the Washington Post even wrote an articles like the new Majority Whip for the House and the majority side is really pro the industry. So he's doing a brilliant job of sort of pushing back. The unfortunate development is that it warns mainly winning over a few Democrats here and there, that I think just a lot of education is needed on the Hill. So if you know a Democrat in Congress that you're constituent of, whether it's a senator or a representative, give them a little talk about bitcoin and what it does and help remind them of the basics, because the FDX thing was kind of a big cloud. So my point being it's becoming a little bit more of a partisan issue where the party in power in the House, the Republicans are more favorable toward it, where the Senate and the President kind of know a little bit about his thoughts, but not generally. To be honest, when you get over to the White House, their big concern is the whole energy FUD thing that they take seriously. Because somehow Alex de Riz and the dig economist, which has been a detractor and kind of a joke in my mind for years, has been taken quite seriously by the White House and used in their paper. Like quoted directly in his paper is like a paper and a consideration regarding the use of bitcoin. So this is going to be one of those things where everyone's going to kind of moan and groan in general in the US. I think, for the next two years because it's going to kind of be like a do nothing Congress, because they'll be split. But that's probably not all bad because in light of the FTX thing, in light of the way some Democrats, including Warren, are really trying to pull out the sword to chop off bitcoin's head is getting louder, they'll be kind of set off by a Republican House and other things, too. And I think that's good because to be honest, we probably need a couple of years to kind of have the FCX thing fade away when Liber hit. Those who remember Facebook Libra in 2019, that's still in the memory of people in Congress and senators. They have a long memory. So that started fading away by like 2021. Now the push is really, how do we regulate these exchanges? Sorry, here are little background noises. I just got two little pug puppies and they're making a lot of noise. Sorry for that background noise. But anyway, yeah, that's kind of the story. Nico. So one more to you, Jason. Then we'll go back to Dr. Jeff Ross, which is ",
